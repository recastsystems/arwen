"""Which WRF release ArWen is pinned against: ``wrf_reference``.

ArWen's bitwise referee moved from WRF 4.7.1 to WRF v4.8.0 (released
2026-06-08).  4.7.1 stays selectable as the previous pin.  This module is
the one authority for that choice: data plus resolvers, importing nothing
heavy at module scope.

* ``wrf_reference`` is one user-facing key: ``[shared]`` of an experiment
  TOML, ``[run]`` of a legacy RunConfig TOML, ``gpuwm import-namelist
  --wrf-reference`` and the WOOF/API field that writes the TOML key.
* It is resolved ONCE, when the configuration is loaded, into the
  per-scheme generation keys (``solar_generation``, ``ysu_version`` ...)
  that the named WRF release runs.  Those keys already bind the restart
  and run identities, so the selector adds no field of its own to
  :class:`gpuwm.config.RunConfig`, and an omitted selector changes nothing.
* A per-scheme key written beside it still wins, as ``bl_mynn_version``
  does today.
* Omitted, the engine runs its defaults: the newest generation of every
  pins are for bitwise proof).  ``"4.8.0"`` pins the schemes WRF 4.8.0
  itself ships, ``"4.7.1"`` the ones WRF 4.7.1 ships.  Which generation
  each release runs is the importer's release table
  (:data:`gpuwm.namelist_import.WRF_RELEASE_GENERATIONS`): one table for
  the namelist door and the run door, so the two cannot disagree.
* The namelist vocabulary follows the same choice: the 4.8.0 Registry
  table for a 4.8 release (and for a bare ``4``, the newest), the 4.7.1
  table for 4.7.1, every older release and the WRF 3 line
  (:func:`registry_reference_for_wrf_version`).

The port lanes that change words (GFL, MYNN-EDMF 8f8e8b5, MYNN-SFC, KIM
drag, Shin-Hong, Fitch induction, TEMPO, lightning) each add their row to
``WRF_RELEASE_GENERATIONS`` and move their keys out of
:data:`WRF480_ONLY_KEYS` when the consumer lands.
