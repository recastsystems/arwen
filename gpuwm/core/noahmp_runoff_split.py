"""Separate surface and subsurface runoff options for Noah-MP.

Re-implemented from published descriptions, not bitwise to upstream.

Noah-MP v5.0 split the single ``opt_run`` into a surface runoff option and a
subsurface runoff option (He et al. 2023, GMD 16, 5131, Sect. 2.6: "we have
separated the runoff options for surface and subsurface runoff processes"),
and WRF 4.8.0 carries them as ``opt_runsrf`` / ``opt_runsub``.  The public
technical description (He et al. 2023, NCAR/TN-575+STR, Sect. 3.7.8) numbers
both lists 1-8 with the same meaning as the old ``opt_run`` and says the
tested choice is the same number for both, so a stock ``opt_run=N`` is the
pair ``(N, N)`` and keeps its meaning exactly.

What the split adds is the mixed pairs, for example VIC surface runoff with
the Niu et al. (2007) groundwater baseflow.  The physics of each half is our
own WRF-v4-lineage port; only the gates move (see
``gpuwm/core/kernels/noahmp_water_split.cuh`` and its generator).  No
NCAR/noahmp or other UCAR-licensed source was read for any of this.

The engine represents a pair as ``opt_run`` = the surface option plus
``opt_runsub`` = the subsurface option when it differs, and 0 when the pair is
stock.  Pairs whose subsurface halves are the same drainage scheme as the
stock pair (subsurface 3, 6, 7 and 8 all use Eq. 3.7.338 with the Eq. 3.7.255
free-drainage bottom flux) collapse to the stock pair, so nothing changes for
them.
