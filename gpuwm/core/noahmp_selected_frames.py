"""Source-bound frame prices for the selected Noah-MP translation units.

Read on test host B, sm_120 / NVRTC 12.9.86, 2026-11-01. All exported
functions were read through the production loader in fast and strict modes;
the readings agree. An unread platform uses the measured ceiling, as the
existing composed-unit estimator does. Changed sources use the tree's
assumed bound until a new reading is added. Default-option pricing is separate.

# name, pricing key, complete translation-unit identity, maximum frame bytes.
# 2026-11-09: the glacier and thermal rows were re-read on test host B (RTX 5090,
# sm_120, NVRTC 12.9) for the sources at rel/2.9.13; their identities had
# moved since the 11-01 reading but the frames read the same (792, 416).
# With the stale identities every selected Noah-MP option was priced at the
# assumed frame bound: a 150x120 3 km domain priced 15.34 GiB instead of
# about 4.7, and was refused on a 24 GB card.
# 2026-11-09 (fix/noahmp-small-defects): every default Noah-MP run now steps
# these selected images (noahmp_surface_device.device_route), so a stale row
# would price every Noah-MP run at the assumed bound.  Re-read on test host B
# (RTX 5090, sm_120, NVRTC 12.9.86, production loader, fresh process, no
# launch) after the SN1 snowmelt-reset edit: every frame below read exactly
# as recorded, and bareflux/vegeflux read 0 B/thread with and without
# GPUWM_NOAHMP_MELT_RESET_ESAT.  The glacier and thermal identities are the
# rel/2.9.13 sources (lane clean-compaction 2f9a3c6a17 read the same).
# 3.0.0 fold: glacier and thermal re-read after opt_tksno entered both units
# (tools/measure_selected_noahmp_frames.py, test host B, NVRTC 12.9.86):
# 792 and 416 B, unchanged; every other row read as recorded.
