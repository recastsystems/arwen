"""Scale-aware ground snow cover fraction for Noah-MP (``opt_scf = 2``).

Re-implemented from published descriptions, not bitwise to upstream.

Only the paper was read.  No Noah-MP v5 source file was opened.

What the paper keeps (its Section 2.2, Eq. 1-3, the Niu and Yang 2007 form our
WRF-lineage port already computes in ENERGY):

    SCF   = tanh(h_sno / (SCfactor * f_melt))                       (Eq. 1)
    f_melt = (rho_snow / rho_new) ** m,  rho_new = 100 kg m-3         (Eq. 2)
    rho_snow = SWE / h_sno                                           (Eq. 3)

What the paper changes (Section 2.3, Eq. 4-5): SCfactor and m stop being
land-cover table values (MPTABLE SCFFAC and MFSNO) and become functions of the
model grid size DX in km, the same for every land type:

    SCfactor = b1 * sinh(b2 * DX) + b2,  [b1, b2] = [0.0062, 0.0555]  (Eq. 4)
    m        = c1 + tanh(c2 * DX),        [c1, c2] = [0.9713, 0.7436]  (Eq. 5)

and Section 2.3 bounds both above by their DX = 36 km solutions (the coarsest
grid the fit used; 0.0779 and 1.9713 as printed).  Both functions increase
with DX, so the bound is applied by evaluating them at min(DX, 36 km): that is
the paper's "solutions of Equations 4 and 5 when DX = 36-km" exactly, rather
than its four-digit rounding.

DX is the grid spacing of the column: the domain ``dx`` on ArWen, the local
cell spacing on a hex variable-resolution mesh (``noahmp_cell_dx`` field).

Evaluated in float64 and rounded once to float32, so the two parameters are
the correctly rounded binary32 values of the paper's formulas for nearly every
DX.  The SCF statement itself is unchanged: the same glibc ``tanhf`` and
``powf`` transcriptions the default path uses.
