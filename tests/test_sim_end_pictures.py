"""`gpuwm sim` ends a run that drew pictures with `gpuwm go`'s render stage over the same folder.

THE BREAKAGE THIS PREVENTS (WOOF canary run_6048ab38808a0625, 2026-11-10): a Hex with Regional 1 km nest runs through
`gpuwm sim`, which drew each frame as it landed and never ran the end-of-run windowed pass, so `uh_2to5km_run_max`
stopped at F002 and `uh_2to5km_3h_max` was never drawn; `gpuwm go` of the same request drew both at every hour.
