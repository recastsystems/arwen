"""No public distribution carries a non-commercial, no-derivatives, GPL or
UCAR-no-sale licence.

The breakage this prevents.  The public packages (``gpuwm``,
``gpuwm-data``, ``gpuwm-kernels``, ``gpuwm-kernels-startup``) are
Apache-2.0, and third-party content may ride in them only under a
permissive licence (BSD, MIT, Apache-2.0, public domain) or CC-BY /
CC-BY-SA data with its attribution.  A file under CC-BY-NC*, CC-BY-ND*,
GPL/LGPL/AGPL or UCAR's "shall not sell" terms attaches that restriction
to whatever carries it.  It has happened: through 2.7.x the companion tree
held the four CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 RFMIP reference results
(``rfmip-clear-sky-reference-{lw,sw}-{up,down}.nc``) beside the shipped
RRTMGP tables, and ``gpuwm_data = ["data/**/*"]`` sweeps in whatever sits
in that directory -- so only an exclusion line stood between them and the
wheel, and stale checkouts still hold them on disk today.  Since 2.8.0 the
tests fetch them from upstream (``gpuwm/core/rfmip_upstream.py``) and
``test_package_data_coverage.py::test_no_rfmip_file_is_carried`` pins those
five names.  This file is the general form: it reads the bytes of every
file each distribution can carry, so the NEXT restricted file is caught by
its licence text, not by its name.

How it reads.  A filesystem walk (not ``git ls-files``), because the
package-data globs sweep up untracked files too: a restricted file left in
a checkout reaches the wheel built from it.  Each file is searched for a
small denylist of licence markers: SPDX identifiers, the licences' own
titles and deed URLs, and UCAR's no-sale clause.  Text files get the whole
list; binary files (a NUL in the first 8 KiB) only the long markers, so
that table bytes cannot match a four-letter identifier by chance.  NetCDF
global ``license`` attributes are stored as plain ASCII, so a restricted
data file is caught by its own embedded licence.

Mentions are not grants.  NOTICE files, provenance tables and refusal
messages name restricted licences precisely in order to keep those works
out, and dual-licensed components ("MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR LGPL-2.1") name
the licence ArWen does not elect.  Each such file is listed in
``_EXPLAINED`` with the exact markers it may contain and why.  The list
cannot go stale: an entry whose file is gone, or whose marker no longer
appears, fails too, so a reason outlives nothing it was written for.
