"""The wave data bridge is staged on demand from the release bundle.

Breakage this prevents (3.0.0 lakes cut, 2026-11-10): from the README's pip install, `gpuwm go --waves on` stopped
with "rw_waves_data is required" because this door looked for the bridge and never asked for the on-demand fetch
that the coupled-preparation door beside it already used. CPU only: the ladder and the fetch are stubbed.
